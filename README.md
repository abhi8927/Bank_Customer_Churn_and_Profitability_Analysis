# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn and Profitability Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes retail banking customers to understand **profitability drivers** and **churn risk** using **MySQL** and **Power BI**.

By designing a normalized SQL data model and applying **rule-based churn risk scoring**, the dashboards identify **high-value customers at risk of attrition** and surface insights to support data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL 8.0** – data modeling, transformations, analytical views  
- **Power BI Desktop** – interactive dashboards and reporting  
- **SQL** – joins, views, aggregations, business logic  
- **DAX** – calculated columns and measures for KPIs and segmentation  

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Public bank churn dataset (Kaggle, *Churn Modelling*)
- **Records:** 10,000 retail banking customers
- **Features include:**
  - Demographics (age, gender, geography)
  - Account balance and salary
  - Product ownership
  - Activity status
  - Historical churn outcome

---

## 🗂️ Data Model
The project uses a **bank-style analytical schema** built in MySQL.

**Core components:**
- **Staging table** for raw churn data
- **Dimension tables**
  - Customer
  - Geography
- **Analytical SQL views**
  - Customer profile view
  - Profitability estimation view
  - Churn risk scoring view
  - High-value at-risk customer view

All business logic is implemented in SQL views to keep Power BI focused on visualization.

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Medium and high-profit customers generate the majority of total profit**
- **Churn risk is significantly higher among low-profit and single-product customers**
- A subset of **high-profit customers shows elevated churn risk**, making them prime candidates for targeted retention outreach

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions & Limitations
- Profitability is estimated using simplified, explainable revenue and cost proxies
- Churn risk scoring is **rule-based**, prioritizing transparency over predictive complexity
- Churn labels are treated as historical outcomes provided by the dataset

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Incorporate **transaction-level data** to capture behavioral churn signals
- Introduce **predictive churn models** to complement rule-based scoring
- Simulate **retention interventions** and estimate ROI impact
